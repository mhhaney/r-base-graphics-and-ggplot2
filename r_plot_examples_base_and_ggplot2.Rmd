## Overview

This document will explore the implementation of various types of plots that can be produced with base R graphics and/or the ggplot2 package. For each plot type we begin by showing basic plots and then enhance the plots by combining plot types, adding new variables using faceting, color, shape or size, or customizing colors, axes, axis labels, annotations or styles.

## Histogram

### Basic Histogram (Base R)

Use the Iris dataset. Show distribution of petal width.

```{r}
hist(iris$Petal.Width,
     main = "Iris Petal Width Histogram",
     xlab = "Petal Width")
```

### Customized Histogram using Base R

```{r}
hist(iris$Petal.Width,                                                
     main = "Iris Petal Width Histogram", xlab = "Petal Width", col='pink', breaks=20, xlim=c(0, 2.9), ylim=c(0, 40))
```

### Creating Histograms for each Species on Petal Width using Base R

```{r}
#Subsetting the different species
set <- iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Species == "setosa"]
ver <- iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Species == "versicolor"]
vir <- iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Species == "virginica"]
par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
hist(set, main = "Iris Setosa Petal Width", xlab = " Petal Width (Cm)", ylab="Frequency", col='orange', breaks=2.5, xlim=c(1.5, 6.5), ylim=c(0, 50))
hist(ver, main = "Iris Versicolor Petal Width", xlab = " Petal Width (Cm)", ylab="Frequency", col='orange', breaks=2.5, xlim=c(1.75, 5.5), ylim=c(0, 50))
hist(vir, main = "Iris Virginica Petal Width", xlab = " Petal Width (Cm)", ylab="Frequency", col='orange', breaks=2.5, xlim=c(1.5, 5.5), ylim=c(0, 50))
```

### Basic Histogram using GGPlot2

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Width)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

### Customized Histogram using GGPlot2

Changing the bins, color, outline color, adding title, and adding x and y labels

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Width)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1.5, color="Blue", fill="orange") + 
  ggtitle("Iris Petal Width Histogram") + 
  xlab("Petal Width") + 
  ylab("Frequency")
```

### GGPlot2 Histogram with Species Added in

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Width)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1.5, color="yellow", aes(fill=Species)) + 
  ggtitle("Iris Petal Width Histogram") + 
  xlab("Petal Width") + 
  ylab("Frequency")
```

### Creating Histograms for each Species on Petal Width using GGPlot2

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Width)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1.5, color="blue", fill="orange") + ggtitle("Iris Petal Width Histogram") + xlab("Petal Width") + ylab("Frequency") + 
  facet_grid(. ~ Species)
```

## Density Curve

### Basic Density Curve Using Base R
```{r}
# get a dataset from R
# Orange dataset has information about the growth of orange trees
orange <- Orange
```

```{r}
# create a density plot
plot(density(orange$circumference),
     main = "CIRCUMFERENCE OF ORANGE TREES",
     xlab = "CIRCUMFERENCE",
     ylab = "DISTRIBUTION")

polygon(density(orange$circumference), col=7, border=2)
```

### Basic Density Curve Using GGPlot2
```{r}
# create the density plot

orange %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = circumference)) +
  geom_density(fill= 7, color= 2)

```
### Adding a Density Plot to the Customized Histogram
Use the same histogram created in the "Customized Histogram Using Base R" section and overlay a density curve on it.
```{r}
x <- iris$Petal.Width
h <- hist(x, breaks=20, col="pink", freq=FALSE, xlab= "Petal Width", main="Histogram With Density Curve")
lines(density(x), lwd=2, col="blue")
```

## Bar Plot
###Base R
```{r}
### Create a data set to work with
survey <- c(apple=45, orange=25, honeydew=35, banana=50, watermelon=20, blueberry=15)

### Create a barchart with titles and color
barplot(survey,
        main="Favorite Fruit Survey",
        xlab="Fruit",
        ylab="Count",
        col=c("red", "orange", "green", "yellow", "pink", "blue"))

### Add a legend
legend("topright",
       legend = c("apple", "orange", "honeydew", "banana", "watermelon", "blueberry"),
       col = c("red", "orange", "green", "yellow", "pink", "blue"),
       pch = 19,
       bty = "n",
       pt.cex = 2,
       cex = 1.2)

```

### GGplot2
```{r}


# Use the same data set created in the base r example but make it into a data frame
survey1 <- data.frame(
  fruit=c("apple", "orange", "honeydew", "banana", "watermelon", "blueberry"),
  value=c(45, 25, 35, 50, 20, 15))

# Create the barchart
ggplot(survey1, aes(x=fruit, y=value)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") 

# Add color with black outlines
ggplot(survey1, aes(x=fruit, y=value)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill=c("red", "orange", "green", "yellow", "pink", "blue"), color="black") + labs(x="Count", y="Fruit", title="Fruit Survey") + theme(legend.position = "none")

```
### Bar plot with data added above the bars (Base R)
First, let's read in some data on passengers who were aboard the *Titanic*.

```{r}
titanic <- read.csv("data/titanic.csv")
```

Next, calculate survival percentage and class count for each passenger
class, using the `aggregate()` function, and then merge those two results into a data frame.
```{r}
# calculate survival percentage by class and count by class.
surv_pct <- aggregate(Survived ~ Pclass, data = titanic, FUN = mean)
class_ct <- aggregate(Survived ~ Pclass, data = titanic, FUN = length)

# Merge those two results into a single data frame, and specify 
# column names
by_class_data <- merge(surv_pct, class_ct,
                       by = "Pclass")
colnames(by_class_data) <- c("Pclass", "Surv_Pct", "Count")
#str(by_class_data)
```

Create the barplot. Note that we increase the `ylim` parameter a bit to leave room for labels above the bars. We also set `axes = FALSE` so that the default y-axis is not plotted. Note also that we assign the barplot object to a variable. What gets assigned to the variable is the x positions of the midpoints of each of the bars on the plot. We will use those x positions later to position the labels above the bars, since the x position for a text label specifies the center of the label.

In the next step we create a custom y-axis with the `axis()` function. The `at` parameter specifies the placement of the tick marks on the axis ("axis ticks") and the `labels` parameter specifies the tick labels. Use the `paste()` function to make percentage labels.

Finally, we create the labels showing the count of passengers in each class and place them right above the bars. The x position comes from the barplot object and the y position is just the height of the bars plus a little extra so that the text labels don't overlap the bars.

```{r}
plt <- barplot(by_class_data$Surv_Pct, 
               names.arg = paste("Class", by_class_data$Pclass),
               col = 'steelblue',
               main = "Survival Percentage by Passenger Class",
               ylab = "Survival Percentage",
               xlab = "Passenger Class",
               ylim = c(0.0, 0.75),
               axes = FALSE
)

# Add y axis
axis(2, at = seq(0.0, 0.7, by = 0.1),
     labels = paste(seq(0, 70, by = 10), "%", sep=""),
     las = 1,
     cex.axis = 0.9)

# Add the text of the labels
text(x = plt, 
     y = by_class_data$Surv_Pct + 0.04, 
     labels = paste("n: ", by_class_data$Count, sep=""), 
     cex=1) 
```

### Bar plot with data added above the bars (ggplot2)

First, let's read in some data on passengers who were aboard the *Titanic*. For the `ggplot2` example we will use the `tidyverse` approach.

```{r message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
titanic <- read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
```

Next, calculate survival percentage and class count for each passenger
class.

```{r}
survival <- titanic %>%  
  group_by(Pclass) %>% 
  summarize(Count = n(),
            Surv_Pct = mean(Survived))
```

Make the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(survival, aes(x = Pclass, y = Surv_Pct)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste("n: ", Count, sep="")), vjust = -0.5) +
  xlab("Passenger Class") +
  ylab("Survival Percentage") +
  ggtitle("Survival Percentage by Passenger Class") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.70),
                     breaks = seq(0, .7, by = 0.10),
                     labels = paste(seq(0, 70, by = 10), "%", sep=""))  +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # Centers title
```

## Line Plot ("Time Series Plot")

## Stacked Area Plot
Data is total steel produced annually from the 5 largest steel producing countries
```{r}
steel <- read.csv("data/steel.csv")
```
## Segmented Stacked Bar Plot

```{r}
ggplot(steel, aes(fill=Country, y=Steel, x=year)) + 
    geom_bar(position="fill", stat="identity") + ggtitle("Share of Steel Produced Annually") + ylab("% of Steel Produced") + xlab("Year")
```

Make the plot. geom_area() is the function that produces the stacked area plot.
```{r}
ggplot(steel, aes(x=year, y=Steel, fill=Country)) + 
    geom_area() + ggtitle("Annual Steel Produced, Top 5 Countries (Million Tons)") + ylab("Steel Produced (Million Tons)") + xlab("Year")
```

## Boxplot
In the Boxplot section add two basic boxplot examples, one utilizing base R and one utilizing ggplot2. Note that even basic examples should have appopriate titles and axis labels.

Base R:
```{r}
# Some data to work with:
data(ChickWeight)
```
```{r}
#Boxplot:
boxplot(ChickWeight$weight ~ ChickWeight$Time,
        main = "Chick Age versus Chick Weight",
        xlab = "Chick Age in Days",
        ylab = "Chick Weight in Grams")
```
ggplot2:
```{r}
p <- ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(group=Time, y=weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Chick Age versus Chick Weight",x="Chick Age in Days", y = " Chick Weight in Grams")+
  theme_classic()
p
```

## Violin Plot
Let's pull the NBA Players data

```{r message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
nba_players <- read_csv("data/nba_players.csv")
```
Pulling data from OKC, UTA, and CHI
```{r}
team <- c(nba_players$TEAM[nba_players$TEAM %in% c("OKC", "UTA", "CHI")])
pts <- c(nba_players$PTS[nba_players$TEAM %in% c("OKC", "UTA", "CHI")])
data <- data.frame(team, pts)
```

### Basic Plot with Base R ###
```{r}
with(data , vioplot( 
  pts[team=="OKC"] , pts[team=="UTA"], pts[team=="CHI"],  
  col= c(255,234,268) , names=c("OKC","UTA","CHI"),
  xlab = "Teams",
  ylab = "Points",
  main = "NBA Points Per Team",
  ylim = c(0,27),
  border = c(sample(200:900, 3)),
  rectCol = c(893)
))
```
### Basic Plot with ggplot2 ###
I did add a boxplot on top of the violin plot to make it resemble the base r graph.
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x= team, y = pts, fill = team)) + 
  geom_violin(trim = F, show.legend = T) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1)
```

## Strip Chart

### Strip chart in base R

#### Use the built-in dataset: iris to create a stripchart for the variable Sepal.Width

Here we can use the `alpha()` function from the `scales` package to set an alpha (transparency) level for the color, ranging from 0 (totally transparent) to 1 (totally translucent). `method - 'jitter'` adds random noise in the y-dimension and the `jitter()` function applied to the variable being plotted adds random noise to the actual values of the variable. `amount = 0` causes that random noise to be z/50 where z is the range of the variable.

```{r}
stripchart(jitter(iris$Sepal.Width, amount = 0),
           main = "Sepal Width Distribution",
           xlab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
           col= alpha("blue", 0.5),
           pch = 19,
           method= 'jitter')
```

### Strip chart in ggplot2

With ggplot2's `geom_jitter()` is a shortcut for `geom_point(position = "jitter"). Its `width` and `height` parameters control the amount of random noise in the x and y dimensions, respectively. With ggplot2 we can set `alpha` directly without the use of any helper functions. However, with ggplot2 it is a bit tricky to make a strip chart for just one variable (without a second variable for grouping), as we need to set the y variable, set axis limits, and suppress the axis ticks and labels for the unused axis.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=0), 
              width = 0.05, 
              height = 0.2, 
              color = "blue",
              alpha = 0.5,
              pch = 19,
              cex = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1, 1),breaks = NULL, labels = NULL) + 
  labs(title = "Sepal Width Distribution",
       y = NULL,
       x = "Sepal Width (cm)")
```

### Strip Chart Divided into Groups, ggplot2

This is fairly easy to do with ggplot2, as `geom_jitter()` by default takes two variables as parameters. One can be the categorical group, iris species.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris) + 

### Add Boxplot on top of the strip plot for iris species. - used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbvU8fF4eGM&t=613s as a reference

  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = iris$Sepal.Width, y = iris$Species, fill = iris$Species),
               alpha = 0.25,
               width = 0.5,
               show.legend = FALSE) +
               
  geom_jitter(aes(y=Species, x=Sepal.Width, color = Species), 
              width = 0.05, 
              height = 0.2,
              pch = 19,
              cex = 2) +
  labs(title = "Sepal Width Distribution by Iris Species",
       x = "Sepal Width (cm)",
       y = NULL) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Strip Chart with NBA Data, ggplot2

Strip charts are particularly useful with small datasets. The NBA data has a small number of players per team, so let's try to use strip charts to compare the distribution of scoring on NBA teams, similar to the comparisons in the violin plot section.

#### Basic Strip Chart of NBA Scoring with ggplot2

```{r}
nba_players %>% 
  filter(TEAM %in% c("OKC", "UTA", "CHI")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x =PTS, y = TEAM)) + 
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Scoring Distribution on Selected NBA Teams")
```

#### More Customized Strip Chart of NBA Scoring with ggplot2

```{r}
top_ten <- nba_players %>% 
  filter(TEAM %in% c("OKC", "UTA", "CHI", "WAS")) %>% 
  group_by(TEAM) %>% 
  arrange(desc(PTS), .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(rn = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(rn <= 10)

top_one <- nba_players %>%
  filter(TEAM %in% c("OKC", "UTA", "CHI", "WAS")) %>% 
  group_by(TEAM) %>%
  filter(row_number(desc(PTS)) == 1)

ggplot(data = top_ten, aes(x =PTS, y = TEAM)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(5, 30, 5)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = PLAYER), 
            data = top_one,
            nudge_x = 0.25,
            angle = 90,
            alpha = 0.5,
            vjust = "top", 
            hjust = "middle") +
  labs(title = "Scoring Distribution of Top 10 Scorers") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0,
               linetype = 3)
```

## Strip Plot showing the distribution of a numberic variable by a categorical variable
```{r}
#This example is similar to the one that Dr. Haney did above, this time with a different dataset with new variables.
data(chickwts)
str(chickwts)

```

```{r}
#in ggplot2:
ggplot(data = chickwts) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(y=feed, x=weight, color = feed), 
              width = 0.05, 
              height = 0.2, 
              alpha = 0.5,
              pch = 19,
              cex = 2) +
  labs(title = "Chick Weight by Feed Type",
       x = "Chick Weight in Grams",
       y = "Feed Type") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
```{r}
# A second example, this time using the Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants dataset
data(CO2)
str(CO2)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = CO2) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(y=Treatment, x=uptake, color = Treatment), 
              width = 0.05, 
              height = 0.2, 
              alpha = 0.5,
              pch = 19,
              cex = 2) +
  labs(title = "Carbon Dioxide Uptake in Grass Plants by Treatment Type",
       x = "Carbon Dioxide Uptake",
       y = "Treatment Type") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


## Normal Probability (QQ) Plot

A quantile-quantile ("QQ") plot is used to compare an empirical distribution to a theoretical distribution by plotting the observed quantiles vs the theoretical quantiles. They are typically used to evaluate whether or not a variable is normally distributed.

The built-in `rivers` dataset gives the lengths (in miles) of 141 rivers in North America, as compiled by the US Geological Survey. Let's see if the river lengths are normally distributed by creating a normal probability plot of the river lengths.

### Basic QQ Plot with Normal Distribution Reference Line (Base R)

Here we create a basic QQ plot in base R and add the normal distribution QQ plot as a reference line for comparison.
```{r}
qqnorm(rivers,
       main = "Q-Q Plot of North American River Lengths")
qqline(rivers, col = "red")
```

### Basic QQ Plot with Normal Distribution Reference Line (ggplot2)

Here we produce a similar plot using ggplot2. First we need to put the river lengths in a data frame.

```{r}
rivers_df <- data.frame(length = rivers)
```

Now we make the plot. Note that the shape and size of the geom are revised to better match the base R plot.

```{r}
ggplot(rivers_df, aes(sample = length)) +
  stat_qq(shape = 1, cex = 2) +
  stat_qq_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Q-Q Plot of North American River Lengths",
       x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
       y = "Sample Quantiles") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # Centers title
```


## Mosaic Plot

### Mosaic Plot with Base R

First, let's read in some data on passengers who were aboard the *Titanic*.

```{r}
titanic <- read.csv("data/titanic.csv")
```

Next we will mosaic plot of Titanic ticket class vs embarkment location. First check to see if there is any missing data.

```{r}
table(titanic$Pclass)
```

```{r}
table(titanic$Embarked)
```

Notice that there are two cases for which blank. We will remove those cases. Also, since `Pclass` is an integer vector it would be best to change it to a factor, and then specify the levels as a character vector. (See `?factor`)

```{r}
mask <- titanic$Embarked %in% c("C", "Q", "S")
embarked <- titanic$Embarked[mask]
class <- titanic$Pclass[mask]
class <- factor(class, levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                labels = c("First", "Second", "Third"))
```

Make the mosaic plot.

```{r}
mosaicplot(table(class, embarked),
           main="Passenger Class by Embarkment Site",
              xlab="Class",ylab="Embarkment Site",
              col=c(2,3,4))
```

### Mosaic Plot with ggplot2

Let's make a similar mosaic plot using ggplot2. We need to use the ggmosaic package to do so.

```{r}
titanic_clean <- titanic %>% 
  filter(Embarked %in% c("C", "Q", "S")) %>%  # Removes cases with missing data
  mutate(
  Embarked = factor(embarked),
  Pclass = factor(Pclass)
)

titanic_m_data <- titanic_clean %>% 
  count(Embarked, Pclass)
```


```{r}
  ggplot(data = titanic_m_data) + 
    geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Pclass), fill = Embarked, weight = n)) +
    xlab("Passenger Class") + 
    ylab("Embarkment Site") + 
  ggtitle("Passenger Class by Embarkment Site")
  
```

## Scatterplots
### Base R
Creating a scatterplot in base R is simple. For this example, I used the dataset
pennsylvania-history, which shows the history of pennsylvania's recorded covid cases
from January to March 7. The variables of interest are positive, the number of positive
cases, and deaths. Did the death count rise as cases grew? 

First, we read the data file, pennsylvania-history.csv and store it as covidchart.
Our x values in the plot function are covidchart$positive, and our yvalue is covidchart$death.
Our title, as explaieid in main is "Covid Infection and Fatalities." Our x-axis is labeled Infections, for covid infections, and our y axis is labeled fatalities. Note that these fatalities are not explciitly confirmed to be from Covid, but are the overall fatality count in PA over time, each point representing a different count of infection and fatality per day.
We then draw a regression line based on positive cases and fatalities. The regression line is colored red and the points are colored grey after the color scheme of the virus itself.
```{r}
covidchart <- read.csv("data/pennsylvania-history.csv")
covidchart <- subset(covidchart, !is.na(positive) & !is.na(death))
plot(covidchart$positive, covidchart$death, main = "Covid Infection and Fatalities", xlab = "Infections", ylab = "Fatalities", col = "grey")
abline(lm(covidchart$death ~ covidchart$positive), col = "red")
```

We can see that, yes, positive cases unfortunately have a positive correlation with fatalities.

## Rcolorbrewer in Base R
Another way to color your plot is by using rcolorbrewer. We first have to load rcolorbrewer

Then, execute this:
```{r}
display.brewer.all()
```
to see all the available palettes. To view a single palette, type

display.brewer.pal(n, name)

name denotes the palette you want to display, while n denotes how many colors are in that palette. For example, 
```{r}
display.brewer.pal(3, "Pastel1")
```
shows you the first three colors in the Pastel1 palette. 


brewer.pal(n, name)

returns the hex codes of the n colors in the name palette, and can be assigned as a vector, your artist's palette Here, we create a palette of all 9 colors in Pastel1 palette. 
```{r}
Past <- brewer.pal(9, "Pastel1")
```
From there, go back to your plot's color argument and type something like
```{r}
plot(covidchart$positive, covidchart$death, main = "Covid Infection and Fatalities", xlab = "Infections", ylab = "Fatalities", col = Past[1])
```
To set the color of the plot to the first color in the "Past" palette we made with colorbrewer.

### ggplot2
ggplot2 is much the same. we set covidchart as the source of our data and positive and death as our x and y values in aes(). geom_point() is called to make ggplot graph this as a scatterplot. The labs() function labels our x and y axes, and the graph overall. To add a regression line, we use geom_smooth(method = lm). 
```{r}
ggplot(data = covidchart, aes(positive, death)) + geom_point(colour = "red") + labs(x = "Infections", y = "Fatalities", title = "Covid Infection and Fatalities") + geom_smooth(method = lm)
```        
### ColorBrewer in ggplot2
In order to use colorbrewer in ggplot2, you have to first save your ggplot in a variable, and then append the function scale_color_brewer() to it, with the argument palette =."palettename" inside the function. Like so:
```{r}
covid <- ggplot(data = covidchart, aes(positive, death)) + geom_point(colour = "red") + labs(x = "Infections", y = "Fatalities", title = "Covid Infection and Fatalities") + geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm)
covid + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Pastel1")
```
Alternatively, you could append the scale_color_brewer function to the ggplot function
```{r}
ggplot(data = covidchart, aes(positive, death)) + geom_point(colour = "red") + labs(x = "Infections", y = "Fatalities", title = "Covid Infection and Fatalities") + geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = lm) + scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Pastel1")
```
## Bubble Plot

### Base R Bubble Plot

Base R plots require a bit finessing to get just right. 

First of all, I plan to place the legend outside the plot itself so I must first change the margins. This is done with `par()` which can set graphical parameters. Within `par()`, `mar` takes a vector input of 4 numbers determining how far into the pane the plot margins should be, starting at the bottom and continuing clockwise. `xpd` takes a logical value & setting it to TRUE tells R not to clip the legend or any other insertion outside the plot bounds. `inset=c(-0.35,0)` tells R to move the legend away from the plot, outside the margin horizontally. To make the legend look a bit cleaner, use `bty='n'` to remove the box around the legend. 

To set the point size in base plot, use `cex=data$variable`. In this case `cex=mtcars$disp`. For the legend, use `pt.cex=c(n1, n2, n3...nx)` for however many legend items you have. I'm choosing intervals of 100 from 100 to 400. 

```{r}
par(mar=c(4, 5, 2, 8), xpd = T) # bottom, left, top, right

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp, cex = mtcars$disp,
     pch=16,
     main = 'Miles per Gallon vs Gross Horsepower with Displacement',
     xlab = 'miles per gallon',
     ylab = 'gross horspower')
legend('right', inset=c(-0.35,0),
       legend=c('100', '200', '300', '400'),
       title = 'Displacement\n(cu. in.)',
       pch=16, ncol=1, pt.cex = c(100, 200, 300, 400),
       bty = 'n')
```

Yikes, it seems like the points may be a bit too large. Lets make them all smaller by dividing their values by 100 & take care not to forget about the legend points as well by changing the values for `pt.cex`. 

```{r}
par(mar=c(4, 5, 2, 8), xpd = T) # bottom, left, top, right

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp, cex = mtcars$disp/100,
     pch=16,
     main = 'Miles per Gallon vs Gross Horsepower with Displacement',
     xlab = 'miles per gallon',
     ylab = 'gross horspower')
legend('right', inset=c(-0.35,0),
       legend=c('100', '200', '300', '400'),
       title = 'Displacement\n(cu. in.)',
       pch=16, ncol=1, pt.cex = c(100, 200, 300, 400)/100,
       bty = 'n')
```

Better, but the points don't seem to be proportional. It seems that `cex` scales points by altering the radius of a point. This would cause the area of each consecutive point to be exponentially larger than the last when using the formula $A=πr^2$. To correct this and make the point size proportional to the area, rearrange the formula to solve for the radius that produces the desired area. $r=\sqrt{\frac{A}{π}}$

Now the points are proportional in area but still too large, so I divide the areas by 5. 

```{r}
par(mar=c(4, 5, 2, 8), xpd = T) # bottom, left, top, right

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp, cex = sqrt(mtcars$disp/3.14)/5,
     pch=16,
     main = 'Miles per Gallon vs Gross Horsepower with Displacement',
     xlab = 'miles per gallon',
     ylab = 'gross horspower')
legend('right', inset=c(-0.35,0),
       legend=c('100', '200', '300', '400'),
       title = 'Displacement\n(cu. in.)',
       pch=16, ncol=1, pt.cex = sqrt(c(100, 200, 300, 400)/3.14)/5,
       bty = 'n')
```

Now it looks right!

### Ggplot2 Bubble Plot

When I need to make a plot, I usually prefer `ggplot()` over base r for its simplicity. As you can see, I was able to make a clean graph with just 5 lines of code. To show  displacement as a variable point size, you set `size=disp` within the aesthetics of ggplot. Ggplot automatically scales by area & makes the points reasonable sizes as well. Because mtcars is set as the data source, there is no need to reference the data frame for each variable. 

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=hp, size=disp))+
  geom_point()+
  ggtitle('Miles per Gallon vs Gross Horsepower with Displacement')+
  labs(size = 'Displacement\n(cu. in.)', x='miles per gallon', y='gross horsepower')+
  theme_classic()
```

## Diverging Bar Chart
```{r}
data(swiss)
```

```{r}

#Data Preparation
swiss$`municipality` <- rownames(swiss)  # create new column for municipality names
swiss$Fertility_z <- round((swiss$Fertility - mean(swiss$Fertility))/sd(swiss$Fertility), 2)  # compute normalized mpg
swiss$Fertility_type <- ifelse(swiss$Fertility_z < 0, "below", "above")  # above / below avg flag
swiss <- swiss[order(swiss$Fertility_z), ]  # sort
swiss$`municipality` <- factor(swiss$`municipality`, levels = swiss$`municipality`)  # convert to factor to retain sorted order in plot.

#Diverging Barplot:
ggplot(swiss, aes(x=`municipality`, y=Fertility_z, label=Fertility_z)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity', aes(fill=Fertility_type), width=.5) +
  theme(text = element_text(size=9)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name="Fertility", 
                    labels = c("Above Average", "Below Average"), 
                    values = c("above"="#00ba38", "below"="#f8766d")) + 
  labs(title= "Divergence in the Average Fertility in Swiss Municipalities",
       x = "Municipality",
       y = 'Fertility') + 
  coord_flip()

```

## Lollipop Chart

### Lollipop Chart with ggplot2

To make a lollipop chart with ggplot2 you can use `geom_point()` for the circle and `geom_segment()` for the stem.

```{R}

let <- data.frame(
  x=LETTERS[1:10],
  y=runif(10, 2, 9)
)
ggplot(let, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_segment( aes(x=x, xend=x, y=0, yend=y), color="black") +
  geom_point( size=4, color="blue", 
              fill=alpha("purple", 0.2), alpha=.8, shape=21, stroke=4) +
  theme_gray() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  xlab("Student") +
  ylab("Hours Spent Studying") +
  ggtitle("Student Hours of Study (per Week)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10))
```

## Diverging Lollipop Chart

Use the state data that comes with R. Let's look at state life expectancy. First, prepare the data that we will use for a couple examples.

```{r}
state_df <- data.frame(state.x77, Region=state.region, Division=state.division)
state_df <- rownames_to_column(state_df, var="State")
state_df$Life.Exp.Z <- 
  (state_df$Life.Exp - mean(state_df$Life.Exp))/sd(state_df$Life.Exp)
state_df$Above.Avg <- ifelse(state_df$Life.Exp.Z >= 0, "yes", "no")
state_df <- state_df[order(state_df$Life.Exp.Z), ]
state_df$State <- factor(state_df$State, levels = state_df$State)
```

Next create a simple diverging lollipop chart to highlight the difference of each state's mean life expectancy from the mean state mean life expectancy.

```{r, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=7.5}
ggplot(state_df, aes(x=State, y=Life.Exp)) + 
  geom_point(stat='identity', fill="black", size=2)  +
  geom_segment(aes(y = mean(Life.Exp), 
                   x = State, 
                   yend = Life.Exp, 
                   xend = State), 
               color = "black") +
  labs(title="State Life Expectancy", 
       subtitle="Deviation from Mean State Life Expectancy",
       y = "Life Expectancy (Years)",
       x = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(68, 74, 1)) +
  coord_flip()
```

Now let's try to view a subset. With a smaller amount of data we can add the life expectancies as labels on the dots.

```{r}
ggplot(filter(state_df, Region == "South"), aes(x=State, y=Life.Exp.Z, label=round(Life.Exp, 1))) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "darkgray") +
  geom_point(stat='identity', aes(col=Above.Avg), size=6)  +
  geom_text(color="white", size=2.2) +
  labs(y = "Standard Deviations from Mean State Life Expectancy") +
  geom_text(aes(x = "West Virginia", 
                y = -0.05, 
                label = "Mean State Life Expectancy"),
            angle = 90,
            color = "darkgray") +
  labs(title="Life Expectancy in the Southern States", 
       subtitle="Compared to Average State Life Expectancy") + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
